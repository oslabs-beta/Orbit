## What is Orbit?

**Orbit** is an open-source developer tool for **GraphQL prototyping** and **relational database visualization**.

It helps you go from a PostgreSQL database to a functional GraphQL API in minutes, complete with an interactive diagram, generated schema, and built-in query testing.

Built to save time during API design, database onboarding, or a REST-to-GraphQL migration, Orbit eliminates the need for manual schema mapping and lets you explore data structure visually before you write a single resolver.

## How It Works

### 1. Connect to a Database

- Enter your PostgreSQL connection URI
- Or choose the built-in sample database to explore features immediately

---

### 2. Visualize Your Data Model

- Interactive ER diagram shows all tables, columns, and data types
- Relationships are highlighted via foreign key links
- Tables can be repositioned for easier viewing and diagram organization

---

### 3. Generate a GraphQL Schema

- Automatically creates `type` definitions and associated resolvers
- Schema view lets you copy the generated code directly into your backend project
- Perfect for kickstarting API development without manual mapping

### 4. Test Queries in the Built-in Playground

- Compose GraphQL queries and mutations interactively
- Browse available fields, types, and relationships in the Docs panel
- Test API design decisions against live data

## Example Use Cases

- **Prototyping a new API** â€“ Start with your existing database, quickly visualize and generate the schema.
- **Onboarding new engineers** â€“ Give them a visual map of the data model plus a live query playground.
- **Transitioning from REST** â€“ Map relational tables into GraphQL types without manual boilerplate.
- **Database exploration** â€“ Use the sample DB to learn GraphQL or demo concepts.
